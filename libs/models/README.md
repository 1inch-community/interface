# @one-inch-community/models

The `@one-inch-community/models` module contains a basic set of models designed to facilitate loose coupling between application modules. This module is monolithic and contains little to no logic.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `@one-inch-community/models` module is to provide a foundational structure for the application, enabling different modules to interact seamlessly without being tightly bound. This approach ensures that the application remains flexible and modular, allowing for easier maintenance and extension.

## Features

- **Loose Coupling**: The models in this module enable smooth interactions between different parts of the application without creating strong dependencies.
- **Monolithic Structure**: Although monolithic in nature, this module is streamlined and lightweight, focusing solely on providing necessary interfaces and models.

The `@one-inch-community/models` module plays a critical role in maintaining the modular architecture of the application, ensuring that different components can work together efficiently while remaining decoupled.
